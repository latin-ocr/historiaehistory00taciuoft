noras το υιῐ. ιι. cu. v. vi. 67

-θιιιΙὶοε, “ That none.'’ Supply Tribunos militares—placuit. “ It.
was resolved.'‘ Literally, it plensed (them). Supply illia—quadri-
ennium itaflua-it. ‘⁸ Four years glided away in such a manner.”
The metaphor in fluxit is taken from the stream of a. river gliding
gradually, yet swffssy, onward. ·According to Livy, the time was
five years—potestates majori-s. “ The higher authorities (of state).'’
There were neither consuls nor decemvirs, nor military tribunes.—
triiennio. “During a space of three yearS.” [ἓ 12o.]—factz·. Sup-
p y eunt.

Proqressus. “Came forward and,'' i. e. from the ranks. Observe
the Latin participle and verb rendered by two English verbs—provoc-
antem. “Challenging (him).’' Supply illum. Who the Gaul was
is not certain; probably he was a man of rank. Suidas calls him
“King of the &stef—collo. Dative dependent on imposito. [ἓ 106,
a.]—su0 refers to the principal word in the sentonee; ιζ’). Titus
Manlius—moa: etiam victi. “Shortly afterwards also they were
conquered.” Supply sunt—non multo post. “Not long afterwards.”
Pbst is an adverb—ducti. “Were led.'’ Supply sunt. Observe
that by the figure “synesis'’ ducti agrees with the persons represented
by millia, not with its grammatical gender [ξ 1601.

cuz-mn VI.

Subacti erant. “ Had been subducd.'’ Pluperfcct indicative
passive of subiqor.—proestarc nollent. “Would not supply.” Observe
that nolo is often rendered, according to its tense, by “willnot‚''
“ would not.'' Nollent is here subjunctive on account of quum—tan-
tum tirones. “ Only raw recruits.'’—qui modus. “And this number.”
Literally, “ which number.” Obscrve that qui relates to legiones
decem and agrees with modus by attraction. Observe, too, the use of
the relative instead of the demonstrative and a conjunction.——armat-
orum. “ Of men carrying arms.'’ It is the genitive dependent on
substantive ‘millia—,parvis adhuc, 551¹. “ Although the Roman state
was as yet small.” Ablative absolute [ἓ 125].

Quoe quum prqfectoe essent. ‘⁴ And when these had set forth.’' Ob-
serve that quoe relates to Zeqz'onem Prqfcctae essent is pluperfect
subjunctive of proficiscor, after quum. [ἓ 153, (1).] Observe also
the use of the relative quoe instead of et hoe. See article qui in Voca-
bulanu—qui esset. “Who was (said to be).” The subjunctive esset
shows that the writer gives this account as the statement of others.
Had he given it as his own, he would have used the indicative erat.
—quum processisset armatus. “When he had come forward in (his)
arms.”—·alis et unquihus. Ablative of instrument after verberavit.
[ξ 112.]—oze rectum. “ That he might be unable to look straight
before himl’ Observe the use of the subjunctive aster the final
conjunction ne. [ξ 152, Ι. (2).]—d‹dit. “He gave;'' i. e. the Gaul
did-idem, ᾆ-σ. “He was also called corvusss’ His descendants
