Postea. “AfterwardsP The time was three years—sub juyum
miserunt. “ Sent under the yoke.'' The juyum consisted of two
spears fixed upright in the ground, at the top of which another was
fastened in a horizonta] position. Under this it was customary for
a victorious general to make the vanquished army pass. The act of
causing any to pass “under the yoke” was emblematical of their
taking the yoke of slavery upon their necks, in the same way that
oxen and horses bear the yoke of their masters, and are compelled
to labour for them, and submit to their authority. The term is of
frequent occurrence in Scriptura—cum ipsis. “With themselves;”
i. e. the consuls.—eo tempore. “At that time.” Ablative of time.
