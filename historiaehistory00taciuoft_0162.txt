the second ten in performing them; the

last ten 18 teaching them to the young ⁴

virgins recently admitted into the order.

Their chief employment was to attend
to the sacred 1118 burniug on the altar of
the goddess; and, as the superstition of
the Romans imagined that fearful calam-

ities would befal the state, if this were
not kept continuany alive, 8, severe
punishment was infficted upon those
who permitted it to expire. They had
also the charge of the Palladium of the
Roman peop1e.11 any violated their
vows os chastity, they were buried alive.
At the same time their honours and priv-
ileges were great. Vestal virgins were
exempt from the cont-rol of parental
authority, and had the power of making
their own wille, though under age. They
could grant a firee pardon toany criminal
being led to execution, if their meeting
him was accidental and unpremeditated.

The utmost respect was shown them by
the citizens of 811 ranks and ages; while
on their approach even the consular
fasces were lowered‚ 18 token of the
honour due to their sacred character.
The order consisted of four, as established
by Numa. Tarquinius Priscus, or Serv-
ius Tullius, added two more. It must be
borne in mind that Rea Silvia, the mother
of Romulus and Remus, was an Alban,
and that vestals were not appointed at
Rome till about sixty years later.
