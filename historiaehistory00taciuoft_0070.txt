Supply, with A. Faber, prcetcreamzcs eos. Or perhaps it would bo
better to supply confir-amus eos, “to compare those; ” i. e. to com-
pare their statemcntS, and adopt, as the true date, the time between
those dates, which they respectively give. With plurimum and
‘minimum supply tempus. [g 153]

CHAPTER 11.

Condita civitate. “After the city had been founded.” Ablative
absolute. [ξ 125.]—leoecsere‘. “ Well nigh these things ;” i. e. much
about what is now going to be stated—finitimorum. These are said
by other authors to have consisted of criminals, debtors, outlaws, and
slaves—the very dregs of the neighbouring states—for whom an
asylum was opened in a wood near Rome—civitatem. “Citizen-
ship,'⁷ or “ the freedom of the state.'⁷—ipse‚ δερ. “ Himself and (his)
people had not wives.” Observc tho use of a plural verb (haberent)
with a composite subject (ipse ct populus). [ξ 92.]—ad spectaculum
ludorum. ‘⁴ To a show of gemes ;'' i. e. to be spectatore of some
games which the Romans were about to celebrate. Livy, i. 9, says
that they were tormed Consualia, and were in honour of Equestrian
Neptune; who was so called from having produced the horse by
striking the earth with his trident. Florus also, i. 1. 10, says that
these were cquestrian gameS. Consus was the god of counsels3 and
probably his name was given to these gemes, because he would be
looked upon as the deity who had suggested the idea of this method
of attracting the neighbouring people2—vz'ez‘7zas urhis Romoe. “ Near
the city of Rome.’' Urbis is the genitive dependent on vicinas, which
is here used as a substantive. [ᾖ 156, (1).] Romoe is the genitive not
dependent upon, but in apposition with, urbia-commotis bellis.
‘⁴ ‘When wars had begun.‘’ More literally, ‘⁸ wars having been set in
moti0n‚” ὅτε. Ablative absolute. [5 125.]—raptarum. “ Of (the
virgins, who had been) carried off.” Supply vi⁷2qi72u772.—vicit. “He
conquered.’' Supplyille‚· i. e. Romulus. [ξ 158.]-ηοη compamcisset.
“He had disappeared.'' Pluperfect subjunctive after quum. Observe
that ποσὶ, prefixed immediately to verbs, not only renders them
negative, but makes up with them a simple meaning direetlycontrary
to their own original signification. Thus here non comparuisset is
not “had not> appeared,” but “had disappsared.'’—-consccrcztus est.
“ He was deified ; ” i. e. placed by the deluded people in the number
of the false gods, whom they worshipped—Romae. “At Rome.”
[ξ 121, Β, ‹tq—his reynantz'bm. “These reigning 3 ” i. e. exercising
the offiee and power of king. Ablative absolute. [ξ 125.]
