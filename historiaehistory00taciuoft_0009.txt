occur. Hence it will be seen that anything like a
philosophical distribution of terms on the plan of a
General Dictionary is not possible: At the same
time it is to be remarked that the various meanings of
the several words found in each Author, are arranged
with as close an approach to the sequence of mear»
ings as circumstances allow.
