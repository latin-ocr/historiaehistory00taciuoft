Marcius. This celebrated general is more

ancl his having taken their city Corioli.
Notwithstanding his numerous military
exlssoits, and the many services he had
rendered to his country, he became un-
popular among the peop1e3 and having
imprudently advised the selling, instead
of the gratuitous distribution, of some
corn, which had been received by the
senate as a present strom Sicily, the trib-
unes raised a sedition againsthim3 and
being brought to trial he was banished
from Rome. Instigated by resentment
on account of this rigorous aud unjust
sentence, he immediately retired from the
city to the enemies whom he had so often
conquered‚ urged them once more to at-
tack the Romans, and offered to head
their armies, With this proposal the

Volsci readily complied; and, after a ,

sei-ies of successful co'ntests with the
forces of his country, his victorious army
pitehed its camp within five miles of
Rome. To save their city from the fatal
effects of his resentment, the Romans
sent to him repeated embassie53 but when
every proposal of reconciliation had been
scornfully rejected, and the destruction
os the city appeared inevitable, the tears
and entreaties of his wife and mother
prevailed on Coriolanus to withdraw his
armies, and to spate his country. But his
compliance with their entreaties proved

fatal to himself. The Volsci, exasperatae .

by his conduct, summoned him to appear
before the people of Antium, and. their
resentment against him was so violent,
that he ἕως murdered before his trial·
