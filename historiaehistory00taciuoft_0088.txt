Quadi-affinia quatuor filiis relictis. ‘⁶ Having left forty-four sonS.''
According to Sallust he left only three legitimate sons, amongst whom
his kingdom was divided, Micipsa, Mastanabal, and ‚Gulussa The
same historiari adds, that the two latter died, and left Micipsa sole
king.—- Scipionem divisorem νέφη· esse jussit. See article jubeo in
Vocabulary.—juvenis adhue. “ (Though) still a young man.’' This
Scipio, called Scipio Africanus the Younger, was made consul at
thirty-six years of age, though the Villian law forbade the enjoyment
of that honour to any under forty-three. Aulus Gellius, x. 28, tells

term puer applied to those under seventeen. Between seventeen and
forty-six a person was a juvenis. After forty-six he became a senior
or senem—ibi. “ There ;’'i. e. in Carthage.—-inventa. Supply'sunt.—-
eoeczdiis. “ Out of the overthrow.'' Observe the use of the plural word
to denote several repeated instances of destruction—quae sua reco-
qnoseebant. “ Which they knew again (as) their own.” Observe the
use of the two accusatives after the factitive verb reeoynoseebant.

with Corintho implied in Corinthiis—propter injuriam.- “ On ac-
count of the ill-treatment.'’ The Corinthiaus first insulted the Roman
ambassadors, and afterwards beat them—Africani. Triumphus is
understood before Africani, Metelli, and Mummii.
