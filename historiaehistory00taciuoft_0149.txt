by the Carthaginizms. His story supplies
n nobie instance of patriotio herniam, and,
nt tho samo time, a melancholy proot ot
the deadly passions of human nature,
even in a tesmod state ot civillsation,
such as the Carthaginians had uttained,
when not curbcd by reugiou. Regulus
would not have his oountry lose its dem-ly
bought advantages by regat-<1 for him.
The carthagiuians, irritated at the re-
fusal of peace. moro especially as this
was through the penna-zion οἰ Regulus,
taxed their ingenuity to devise the most
excruciat‘mg and protracted tot-ments for
their luckless prisoner. According to the
accounts which have come down to us,
they first placed him in a hartel, stuck
{ull oi sharp razors and pointed iron
spikcs; they then cut. off his eye-lidS,
and lert. him to endure the agonies cou-
sequent, upon being exposed, in this
wretched condition, to the terrific hear.
of nn Mrican sun. In this state he re-
maiued for several days, in the most
excruciating torture, till death at length
rclieved him from his tormentors and
their torments.
