merosolyma, orum, n. plur. Hiero-
solyma (or herusalem„ the chief city of
Judaea. Before it was wrested from its
original inhabitants by the Israelites, it
was called Jebuz ; its present possessors
have named it chun or Golz. This city
has been rendered illustrious by the marks
of the Divine favour, which it long re-
ceived. While the rest of the world was
sunk in the grossest idola-try, the know-
ledge of the true God was still preserved
at Jerusalem : there most of the inspired
prophets delivered their predictions, and
laboured to reform their countrymen3
there the Gospel of J esus Christ was first
preached; and there the long—expected
Messian finished the work of man's salv-
ation, by dying on the cross. To punish
the Jews for their impiety and 111015οᾱ-
11055, their city was often given up for a
period into the hands of their enemies;
but it was not wholly destroyed till they
had filled up the measure of their iniqui-
ties by crucifying the Son 01 Gon. After
a long and miserable siege, it was taken
by Titus, on the Sth of September, A. D.
70, and made a heap of ruins. About
sixty years after its destruction, a small
city was built on its site, which, after
having been in the possession of many
different masters is now under the power
of the Ottoman Turks.
