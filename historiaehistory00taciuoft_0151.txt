VOCABULARY.

Rea silvia, to become ι vestan virgin, in
the 'ou that, by these stepS,110no
would be born ω attempt the recovery
ol the cmwn, and to avenge the injurios
done to Numitor. Rea Silvia, however,
gave birth ιο male twins, whose father
she alleged
hope, donbtless, that, by εο doing, her
crime would be overlooked by a super-
stitious people. This, however, was not
the cese. She was buried alive: while
the king ordered her two infant boys to
be thrown into the Tiber. The persons,
to whom was intrusted the execution of
thie inhumari command, placed the new-
born infante in a basket, which they
committed to the river. It happened,
however, that the river hnd then over-
flowed its banks, so that the basket could
not be placed in the course of thc cur-
rent3 and, therefore, when the waters
retired, it was left on the ground. Ac—
cording to the common account, a wolf,
hearing their eries, came to them, and,
instead of :levoni-ing them, gave them
suck. While at the breast of this strange
nurse, they were discovered by Faust-
ulus, the king's shepherd, who carried
them home, and brought them up as his
own children. When they had attained
the age of eighteen years, they frequently
put themselves at the head oi a band of
treebooters, and plundered the surround-
ing country. Iu one ot these marauding
excursione Remus was made prisoner.
The usurping monarch, before whom he
was carried, learning that he had (levast-
ated the property of Numitor, ordered
him to be given up to that prince for
punishment. Hereupon, Faustulus, see-
ing his foster—child in danger, discovered
to Numitor the secret of his finding him;
and suggested, that, from comparing the
time and circumstances, it might be con-
cluded that it was his daughter-’s son,
who stood before him. The result was
the conviction in Numitor's mind that
such was really the case; and a plot was
formed, which ended in the destruction
o! Amulius, and the restoration ot his
deposed brother.
