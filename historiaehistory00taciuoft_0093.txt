Delatum. Supply cst—Mithridates cum uxorefuyit. ‘⁴ Mithrida-
ten and his wife fied with two attendants.” Observe that, when au
ablativo governed by cum follows a nominativo, the verb following
ought strictly to be in the plural, as the cum with its case is equival-
ent to et and another nominative. Sometimes, however, the verb is
in the singular, as here. [P. 133, R] The nominativo in this con-
struction points out the moro important person-coactus ad mortem.
“Having been driven to destroy himself.'’ Literally, “having been
forced to death.‘’—inycntis industrioe consiliique. “ Of great activity
and skilll’ These are genitives of tho quality. [ξ 128.]

Observe that ne and quidem are never written together; some word
comes between them, and that word they strongly qualify. —tributi

i. e. those manifested tokens of the Divine will from prodigies. The
omens here alluded to are, that one of tho stnndards for a long time
resisted the efforts of those, who attempted to pull it out of the
ground; and that another, while being conveyed across the river, was
forced out of the hand of its benrer, and swept down the stream. -—
perditas ree. ‘Their ruined circumstances' Q—yussus Su pply est. —
congregatos. “Collected together? ’—su9it. Observe that this verb
takes the number of the nominative nearest to it (nobilitas), instead
of being in the plural, in which it would be expected to be from
the other nominative cases preceding. The reason is, that nobilitas
is here the principal word: i. e. the word to which most importance is
attached by the mitem—fecit se. “Made himself.” This' 1s an error
on the part of Eutropius. Caesar was dictator after he returned from
Spain, and not before he proceeded to that country. Moreover, he
was appointed by the senate, · he did not assume the office, · and even
after his appointment, he resigned it at the end of eleven days—
sequi noluit. “Would not engage in a pursuitl' Observe that sequi
is here used in an intransitive foree.—- neo Pompeeum. “Thac
both Pomp ey did not know how to conquer. ’-’et illo, ἅτ. “And

that, on that day alone, he, himself, could have been overcomess’
Observe that se applies to Caesar.
